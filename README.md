# com_users Drop-in Admin replacement for Easy Profile Pro

Managing users can be painful, especially when all you see is text. So why not personalize it a little bit more, and even get to recognize some of your clients by their avatars or faces? One lightweight social tool I use is Easy Profile Pro which has the ability for developers to extend code, which is why I like it and its potential.

This com_user replacement is just a patch based on the current Joomla 3.7.2 to allow admins to view their users with avatars drawn from the Easy Profile Pro database.
